# Getting Started

Let's get started with **Conflict in less than 5 minutes**.

## Installation

Create a new Conflict project in the current directory with

npx create-conflict-app
```

If you want to install the command on your system to use it later, run
```bash
npm install -g create-conflict-app
```
