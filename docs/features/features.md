# Features

Conflict has a few key features that make up the core of the framework.

## [Views](/features/views)
Views are collections of components that form a message, can take in arguments, and are typically used to respond to commands.

## [Commands](/features/commands)
Commands are automatically registered and allow you to respond to user actions. Commands are the entry point for using your bot.

## [Events](/features/events)
The events manager lets you subscribe to events neatly in separate files for each event. Events range from Discord events to time-based events to custom events.

## [Components](/features/components)
Just like React components, Conflict components can take in arguments and be used to structure parts of message like branded embeds for your bot.

## [State](/features/state)
State lets you store information about users, guilds, or commands in memory neatly throughout the entire bot.
